# Samvaad Charades — hosting task (25 Oct 2026)
Task: host existing pnpm monorepo (Fastify 5 API + React/Vite web, PostgreSQL) without rebuilding. Demo 27 Oct 2026.
User choices: Emergent managed email for OTP; publish seeded Report 38 sample pages (pending: publish gate needs verification); ADMIN_EMAILS=game_admin@cag.gov.in; BHASHINI key not rotated (use current); glossary CSV must drive workbench menus (already in seed/glossary.json, all 11,686 records present).
## Done
- Install, web build, tests: shared 21/21; api 27/27 (needed --hookTimeout=120000 in this pod; default 10s hook times out).
- Preview hosting: /app/frontend/package.json start -> scripts/emergent/start.sh (local PostgreSQL 15, data /app/.data/postgres; API NODE_ENV=production on :3000 serving web+/api). /app/backend/server.py = pass-through proxy for /api (HTTP+WS) to :3000.
- OTP sender: Emergent managed email added in apps/api/src/auth.ts + env.ts (EMERGENT_EMAIL_KEY, EMAIL_FROM_NAME); SMTP path unchanged.
## Blockers / pending decisions
- Emergent native production deploy supports Python/Next.js backends + MongoDB only; no Postgres, ephemeral disk.
- Publishing requires every part verified; no manager inbox access for agent.
- DHRUVA_API_KEY / DHRUVA_TTS_SERVICE_ID not yet entered in secrets.
## 25 Oct 2026 — iteration 2
- ADMIN_EMAILS -> bhattastha.dibd@gmail.com; old game_admin@cag.gov.in admin row removed.
- Published all 5 seeded Report 38 pages (Trial x2, Primary 10pp, Secondary 20pp, Pro 30pp) at owner request: parts marked verified, audit_logs entries "hosting-agent (owner request)" note references NOT manager-verified. 6 fields (pro 4, secondary 2) have no BHASHINI draft.
- Fixed profile dropdown hidden under body: index.css `.ob-bg/.rules-room > :not(header)`; nav no-wrap.
- Glossary: all 11,686 CSV records already in seed/glossary.json (11,389 terms in DB); inline menus verified.
- Office -> address autofill verified.
- BLOCKER: Emergent email proxy now rejects @cag.gov.in (422 undeliverable_recipient). Needs CAG/NIC SMTP_URL.
- Ops: after rebuilding web dist, restart `frontend` supervisor (static routes registered at boot).
## 25 Oct 2026 — iteration 3 (BHASHINI Dhruva + glossary)
- Dhruva for translation (drafts), transliteration, TTS, LLM, ASR. Console page /manager/services edits service IDs/models (config_overrides key "services", audited, Test buttons). Key DHRUVA_API_KEY in secrets — Key re-entered 25 Oct; all 4 service tests pass. 99/100 Sahayak lines regenerated with Dhruva male voice.
- Official glossary = seed/glossary.anuvaad.csv (11,686 rows → 11,389 terms; blank/"-" Target term 1 promotes first other term). All "Other target terms" accepted, no auto-avoid. Console import accepts Anuvaad columns; merge (default) or replace (guarded). Page term snapshots now follow the live glossary (menus + scoring).
- Workbench glossary menu: last option = BHASHINI transliteration of the English term (only shown on a real suggestion).
- Tests: shared 21/21, api 27/27 (hookTimeout 200 s), testing agent iteration_3 100%.
## Backlog
- P0: re-enter correct Dhruva key; CAG/NIC SMTP for @cag.gov.in OTP; production hosting decision (Emergent native can't run Fastify+Postgres).
- P1: "Review build" tag on sample pages; office search ranking; console glossary delete-term action.
- Deferred by user: Claude integration.
- Console glossary page lists ALL terms A→Z with paging (100/200/500 per page), search across English/Hindi/accepted forms (25 Oct).
## 25 Oct 2026 — Emergent publish packaging
- scripts/emergent/package.sh (run before every publish): bundles API → backend/hc/api.mjs (+config/content/seed/assets, vendored pglite & pdfjs), web → frontend/site. frontend `yarn build` copies site→build. backend/server.py spawns bundle with pip Node (nodejs-wheel-binaries) when monorepo absent; watchdog restarts; PGlite fallback if DATABASE_URL unreachable (NON-PERSISTENT); SEED_PUBLISH_SAMPLES publishes 5 samples on fresh DB.
- Certificate PDF/PNG falls back to HTML when playwright-core absent. Glossary override:null fix.
- P0: external PostgreSQL DATABASE_URL (live slot) for persistence in production.
## 26 Oct 2026 — load + cross-browser readiness
- Load test (preview): 10/20/25 concurrent players, 0 app errors, p95 well under 1 s for game calls; BHASHINI stable. Test players qa.load01-25, qa.xb01-15, qa.xc01-07 @gmail.com left in DB.
- Fixes: Esc keyboard lock in fullscreen (Chrome/Edge); Firefox/Safari full-screen exits not counted (tab/blur still are); GlossMenu outside-click listener stable; header nav at lg, name chip at xl; register card fits 360px; landing Sign in on mobile; TTS 30 uncached/user/10 min; xlit timeouts don't trip breaker; /health alias in shim.
- Production deploy: build passes now; pod OOM at tier_0 512Mi because embedded PGlite (peak ~770 MB). With external Postgres the API measured ~100 MB steady / ~190 MB peak. Needs external DATABASE_URL (live) and/or higher tier.
